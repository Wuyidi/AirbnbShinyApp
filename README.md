## Introduction
In only a little over seven years, Airbnb has become a $25.5 billion juggernaut with over 2 million listings across more than 190 countries. However, Airbnb’s popularity and growth has not come without controversy. Sydney and Melbourne are Australia’s Airbnb’s hotspot, accounting for more than 45 percent of nation’s listings which is the reason why I choose these two datasets to research the Airbnb’s market in Australian. The motivation of this visualization is help us to present a current state of Airbnb in Melbourne and Sydney metropolitan region. 

##Data ExplorationIt is important by begin with discussing a few definitions and fundamental components of Airbnb data. The first is room type.  Airbnb room can be listed as one of three types relating to the extent of the property which is able to be booked: 
1.	Entire Home/apt: The entire home and apartment is  available2.	Private room: One room within house or apartment is available3.	Shared room: A bed within a room shared by other occupants is available
Next, Airbnb listings are classified into a property type. There are more than 19 different property types within the Melbourne and Sydney data. The most common are apartment and house. So, for the sake of this analysis, these twenty types will be collapsed into two types: house and apartment.
